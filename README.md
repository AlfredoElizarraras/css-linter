# CSS Linter

> This project is completed by Oscar Alfredo G칩mez Elizarrar치s, in partial requirements of the Microverse cirriculum. 

---

## Built With

- Ruby 2.6.5

---

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 2.6.5

### Install

`git clone https://github.com/AlfredoElizarraras/css-linter.git`

#### On command line:
`bundler install`

### Use

1. Before running the linter, it needs a yaml file in the root directory, named checks.yml with the property 'Enabled: true' in the checks we want to perform.
 - Example of checks:
 ```
  --- 
  Checks:
  - spaces_before_first_brace:
    - Enabled: true
  - spaces_after_first_brace:
    - Enabled: true
  - rules_indentation:
    - Enabled: true
  - space_after_colon:
    - Enabled: false
  - no_uppcase_selectors:
    - Enabled: false
 ```
2. Then we call the linter adding the path of the file we want to check.
  - For example:
  ```
  ruby bin/main.rb examples/styles.css
  ```
3. We will get the feedback from the linter with the total and details of errors and/or warnings we want to change.
  - Example of output:
  ```
    Number of errors: 8

    Messages from spaces_before_first_brace:
      - There's a missing space at line:  1
